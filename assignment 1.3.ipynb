    " (ii)Tuples:-Tuples are similar to lists but are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be modified once defined.\n",
    " \n",
    " (iii)Dictionaries: Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs. They provide fast access to values based on their associated keys.\n",
    " \n",
    " (iv) Sets: Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. They are useful when you want to eliminate duplicate values or perform set operations like union, intersection, or difference.\n",
    " \n",
    " (v)Arrays: Arrays are used to store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. They offer fast and efficient access to elements based on their indices."
